### About

!MoviÆŽSElecT. is a small application intended for those movie enthusiasts out there. If you have a folder on your PC fully dedicated to storing all those downloaded movies, then this app will be your lifesaver at the end of the day.

If you find yourself imposible to choose from all those titles, this app will do the work for you by picking a random title, selected from a list generated when reading the folder's path where those movies are stored on your system.

This app is my first of many GUI projects I intend to work on with the Tkinter's package from Python.

### Disclaimer!

The app hasn't been finished, or at least not to it's desired entirety. It's main task as I said is functional, but I still intend to make it easier for those using the app, to be able to jump right into the movie without going through the hassle of searching it themselves. 

### Thank you and I hope you like and enjoy it.
